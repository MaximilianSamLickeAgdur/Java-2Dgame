# Java-2Dgame
Java 2D-game , tried to make it as close as possible to the real deal: the classic Missile command i played as a kid. \
Everything was done object-oriented in Java.\
Did it as a hobbyproject but added documentation to showcase professional abilities.\
Tried to follow the factory design pattern as much as i could although there are still some unnecessary dependencies.

# Trying the game
The game designing was not made responsively so the screen size matters. Also it was not made for cross-platform usage \
You need to be on a linux-ubuntu system otherwise you have to change the pathways for rendering the images.
