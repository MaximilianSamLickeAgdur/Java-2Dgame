# Java-2Dgame
Java 2D-game , a clone of the classic Missile command i played as a kid.
Everything was done object-oriented in Java.
Did it as a hobbyproject but added documentation to showcase professional abilities.
Tried to follow the factory design pattern as much as i could although there are still some unnecessary dependencies.
